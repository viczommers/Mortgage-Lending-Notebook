# Mortgage-Lending-Notebook
> Here we use Plotly graphic package with simple iPywidgets inputs to create dynamic visualisations. This is a simple solution for building interactive Jupyter notebooks (which is more robust than using Flask framework).
- This repo includes local machine version of Notebook (that uses default render).
- iPywidgets interactivity **will be enabled only when the code cell is executed in a kernell**.
- Google colab version of notebook with rendered output is available [**HERE**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cVYFSh35U2sVySf9CBrQzQ1xPj-cXmz4?usp=sharing).
